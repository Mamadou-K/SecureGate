## ‚ú® Features

* **üîë Password Protection:** Secure access control using a user-defined numeric password.
* **üî¢ Keypad Interface:** Intuitive input via a standard 4x4 matrix keypad (adaptable to 4x3 with code modification).
* **‚öôÔ∏è Arduino Compatibility:** Built for easy deployment on popular Arduino boards (e.g., Uno, Nano).
* **üîî Status Feedback:** Visual (LED) and auditory (buzzer) feedback for correct/incorrect password entries.
* **üìà Expandable:** Future support planned for EEPROM password storage and multi-user access.


## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to get SecureGate up and running on your Arduino board.

### Prerequisites

*   Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
*   An Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano).
*   A 4x4 or 4x3 matrix keypad.
*   A servo motor or solenoid for gate control.
*   Optional: LED, Buzzer, and LCD for feedback.

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    Start by cloning the SecureGate repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mamadou-K/SecureGate.git
    cd SecureGate
    ```

2.  **Open in Arduino IDE**
    Open the `gate_control.ino` file located in the cloned directory using the Arduino IDE.

3.  **Install Required Libraries**
    SecureGate relies on the `Keypad` library. If you don't have it installed, you can install it via the Arduino IDE's Library Manager:
    *   Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries...`
    *   Search for "Keypad" and install the library by Mark Stanley, Alexander Brevig.

4.  **Hardware Connections**
    Connect your keypad, gate mechanism (servo/solenoid), and optional feedback components (LED, buzzer) to your Arduino board as follows (adjust pin numbers in `gate_control.ino` if necessary):

    *   **Keypad:** Connect the keypad rows and columns to the digital pins specified in `gate_control.ino` (e.g., `ROW_PINS`, `COL_PINS`).
    *   **Gate Control:** Connect your servo motor's data pin or solenoid's control pin to a digital pin (e.g., `GATE_PIN`).
    *   **Status LED (Optional):** Connect an LED (with a current-limiting resistor) to a digital pin (e.g., `LED_PIN`).
    *   **Buzzer (Optional):** Connect a buzzer to a digital pin (e.g., `BUZZER_PIN`).

5.  **Configure `gate_control.ino`**
    Before uploading, you may want to customize the default password and pin assignments:

    ```cpp
    // In gate_control.ino
    const char DEFAULT_PASSWORD[] = "1234"; // Change this to your desired password
    const byte ROWS = 4; // Number of keypad rows
    const byte COLS = 4; // Number of keypad columns
    char keys[ROWS][COLS] = {
      {'1','2','3','A'},
      {'4','5','6','B'},
      {'7','8','9','C'},
      {'*','0','#','D'}
    };
    byte rowPins[ROWS] = {9, 8, 7, 6}; // Connect to the row pinouts of the keypad
    byte colPins[COLS] = {5, 4, 3, 2}; // Connect to the column pinouts of the keypad

    // Pin for the gate control (e.g., servo, relay for solenoid)
    const int GATE_PIN = 10;
    // Pin for the status LED (optional)
    const int LED_PIN = 11;
    // Pin for the buzzer (optional)
    const int BUZZER_PIN = 12;
    ```

6.  **Upload to Arduino**
    *   Select your Arduino board (`Tools > Board > Arduino Uno` or your specific board).
    *   Select the correct port (`Tools > Port`).
    *   Click the "Upload" button (right arrow icon) to compile and upload the sketch to your board.


## üí° Usage Examples

Once uploaded, the SecureGate system will be ready for use.

### Basic Operation

1.  **Power On:** The system will initialize. The gate will be in its default (e.g., locked) state.
2.  **Enter Password:** Use the keypad to enter the configured password (e.g., `1234`).
3.  **Gate Action:**
    *   If the password is correct, the gate will perform its unlock action (e.g., servo moves, solenoid disengages).
    *   If the password is incorrect, an error feedback (LED blink, buzzer sound) will be provided, and the gate will remain locked.
4.  **Re-lock:** After a configurable delay, the gate will automatically return to its locked state.

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Roadmap

SecureGate is continually evolving! Here are some planned features and improvements:

*   **‚úÖ Implement EEPROM for Persistent Password Storage:** Allow the password to be saved and recalled even after power cycles.
*   **üöß Add Multiple User Password Support:** Enable different passwords for various users with customizable access levels.
*   **‚ú® Develop a Mobile App Integration:** Explore Bluetooth or Wi-Fi modules for remote control and monitoring.
*   **üí° Refactor Code for Improved Modularity:** Enhance code organization and reusability for easier maintenance and expansion.
*   **üîÑ Add a "Change Password" Functionality:** Implement a secure way to update the password directly from the keypad.


## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions to make SecureGate even better! Please follow these guidelines:

### Code Style

*   Adhere to standard Arduino C++ coding conventions.
*   Use meaningful variable and function names.
